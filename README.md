I have split out the Angular client from being included in the .sln file as I like to debug Angular apps in VS Code.
To run the Angular client, use a terminal in VS Code or a cmd prompt and run 'npm start'. It will then be hosted to https://localhost:4200

Make sure to restore nuget packags in Visual Studio & run 'npm install' in VSCode/cmd prompt before debugging.
